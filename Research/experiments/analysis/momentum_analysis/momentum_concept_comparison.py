print("   Traditional metrics miss the 'threat level' context")
print("   Momentum = Real-time attacking danger assessment")

print("\n📊 COMPARISON EXAMPLES:")

print("\n1️⃣ POSSESSION PERCENTAGE ALONE")
print("-" * 40)
print("   SCENARIO A: Team with 80% possession")
print("   • Passes: 45 (mostly sideways/backward)")
print("   • Shots: 0")
print("   • Location: Own half")
print("   → Traditional metric: EXCELLENT (80%)")
print("   → Momentum score: 4.2/10 (MEDIUM - not threatening)")
print("   💡 High possession ≠ High threat")

print("\n   SCENARIO B: Team with 35% possession")
print("   • Passes: 12 (direct, forward)")
print("   • Shots: 4")
print("   • Location: Final third")
print("   → Traditional metric: POOR (35%)")
print("   → Momentum score: 6.8/10 (HIGH - very threatening)")
print("   💡 Low possession can = High threat")

print("\n2️⃣ SHOT COUNT ALONE")
print("-" * 40)
print("   SCENARIO A: 1 shot from counter-attack")
print("   • Quick break, clinical finish attempt")
print("   • No sustained pressure")
print("   • Team mostly defending")
print("   → Traditional metric: 1 shot")
print("   → Momentum score: 3.5/10 (LOW-MEDIUM)")
print("   💡 Quality shot but no momentum")

print("\n   SCENARIO B: 5 shots from sustained attack")
print("   • Constant pressure for 10 minutes")
print("   • Multiple chances created")
print("   • Opponent struggling to clear")
print("   → Traditional metric: 5 shots")
print("   → Momentum score: 8.2/10 (HIGH)")
print("   💡 Multiple shots = building momentum")

print("\n3️⃣ PASS ACCURACY")
print("-" * 40)
print("   High pass accuracy (95%) in own half")
print("   → Traditional metric: EXCELLENT technical play")
print("   → Momentum assessment: Not threatening opponent")
print("   💡 Perfect passing ≠ Attacking momentum")

print("\n4️⃣ EXPECTED GOALS (xG)")
print("-" * 40)
print("   xG measures shot quality historically")
print("   Momentum measures threat level NOW")
print("   • xG: 'How good were those chances?'")
print("   • Momentum: 'How dangerous are they right now?'")

print("\n🎯 MOMENTUM CAPTURES WHAT MATTERS:")
print("   ✓ Real-time threat assessment")
print("   ✓ Combines multiple attacking indicators")
print("   ✓ Context-aware (not just raw numbers)")
print("   ✓ Forward-looking (building pressure)")
print("   ✓ Intuitive for coaches/commentators")

print("\n🔍 MOMENTUM FORMULA BREAKDOWN:")
print("   Each weight reflects THREAT CONTRIBUTION:")

# Show specific weight reasoning
print("\n   SHOTS (×2.0) - Highest weight")
print("   → Direct goal attempts = immediate danger")
print("   → Most feared action by defenders")
print("   → Clearest momentum indicator")

print("\n   ATTACKING ACTIONS (×1.5) - High weight")
print("   → Dribbles/carries = progress toward goal")
print("   → Breaking defensive lines")
print("   → Building toward shots")

print("\n   POSSESSION (×0.05) - Lower weight")
print("   → Foundation but not threat by itself")
print("   → 60% possession = only +3.0 momentum")
print("   → Must be combined with forward actions")

print("\n   INTENSITY (×0.3) - Burst indicator")
print("   → High activity = sustained pressure")
print("   → Indicates team 'on the front foot'")
print("   → Tempo building toward breakthrough")

print("\n   EVENTS/MIN (×0.5) - Activity baseline")
print("   → Overall involvement in dangerous areas")
print("   → Distinguishes active vs passive phases")

print("\n🎮 REAL EXAMPLES WHERE MOMENTUM DIFFERS:")

print("\n   📺 COMMENTARY SCENARIOS:")
print("   Traditional: 'Team A has 70% possession'")
print("   Momentum-aware: 'Team A building momentum with 3 shots in 5 minutes'")

print("\n   Traditional: 'Team B completed 89% of passes'")
print("   Momentum-aware: 'Team B under pressure, forced into defensive passes'")

print("\n   ⚽ COACHING DECISIONS:")
print("   Traditional stats: 'We're dominating possession'")
print("   Momentum analysis: 'We're not creating enough threat - push higher'")

print("\n   Traditional stats: 'They had more shots'")
print("   Momentum analysis: 'Their momentum peaked at 65 minutes - that was the danger period'")

print("\n✅ MOMENTUM VALIDATION:")
print("   🎯 Matches soccer intuition: 'Who's dangerous right now?'")
print("   📊 Combines multiple threat indicators intelligently")
print("   ⚡ Real-time assessment for live situations")
print("   🧠 Actionable insights for tactical decisions")
print("   💬 Natural language for commentary/analysis")

print("\n📋 SUMMARY:")
print("   Momentum ≠ Any single traditional metric")
print("   Momentum = Intelligent combination of threat indicators")
print("   Purpose: Answer 'How dangerous is this team RIGHT NOW?'")
