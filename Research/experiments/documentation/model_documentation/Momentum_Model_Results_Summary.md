## 🔧 Features Used (Ranked by Importance)

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Description |
|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | attacking_actions | 0.322 | Count of shots, dribbles, carries |
| 2 | events_per_minute | 0.206 | Activity intensity over 3 minutes |
| 3 | possession_pct | 0.166 | Team possession percentage |
| 4 | total_events | 0.150 | Total team events in window |
| 5 | pass_count | 0.052 | Number of passes |
| 6 | carry_count | 0.041 | Number of ball carries |
| 7 | recent_intensity | 0.026 | Last minute activity (weighted 2x) |
| 8 | dribble_count | 0.021 | Number of dribbles |
| 9 | shot_count | 0.017 | Number of shot attempts |

### Key Insights:
- **Attacking actions** are the most important predictor (32.2%)

- **Possession percentage** provides strong contextual information
- **Recent activity** matters but less than overall 3-minute patterns

## 📈 Prediction Examples

### Real-Time Momentum Tracking
From Netherlands vs England match:

**Early Game (0:00)**
- Netherlands: 8.76/10 - HIGH MOMENTUM
- England: 8.76/10 - HIGH MOMENTUM

**Mid-Period (0:39)**
- Netherlands: 9.41/10 - HIGH MOMENTUM (68.4% possession)
- England: 9.85/10 - HIGH MOMENTUM (31.6% possession)

**Late Period (1:50)**
- Netherlands: 9.71/10 - HIGH MOMENTUM (49% possession)
- England: 9.70/10 - HIGH MOMENTUM (51% possession)

### Momentum Score Calculation
```python
momentum = min(10, max(0,
    attacking_actions * 1.5 +
    possession_pct * 0.05 +
    shot_count * 2.0 +
    recent_intensity * 0.3 +
    events_per_minute * 0.5
))
```
