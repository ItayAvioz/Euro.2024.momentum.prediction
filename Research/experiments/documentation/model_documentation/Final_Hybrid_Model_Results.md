## 🚀 **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**

### Real-World Examples

#### **Scenario 1: Netherlands Building Momentum**
- **Context**: Netherlands pressing forward with attacking intent
- **Current Momentum**: 10.0/10 (Team) vs 8.2/10 (Opponent)
- **Momentum Advantage**: +1.8
- **Future Prediction**: 10.0/10 (Stable)
- **Tactical Advice**: Maintain current approach, momentum is stable

#### **Scenario 2: England Under Pressure**
- **Context**: England struggling against dominant opponent  
- **Current Momentum**: 5.1/10 (Team) vs 10.0/10 (Opponent)
- **Momentum Advantage**: -4.9
- **Future Prediction**: 10.0/10 (Building)
- **Tactical Advice**: Significant improvement predicted

### Commentary Integration
```python
# Example live commentary with hybrid model
current_momentum = 6.8  # From summary model
future_momentum = 7.2   # From hybrid model

commentary = f"""
Netherlands showing strong momentum ({current_momentum}/10) and model 
predicts this will increase to {future_momentum}/10 in the next 3 minutes. 
Current momentum advantage of +2.1 over England suggests continued pressure.
