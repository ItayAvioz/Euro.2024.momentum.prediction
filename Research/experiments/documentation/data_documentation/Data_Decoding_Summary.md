# üèÜ Euro 2024 Data Decoding Complete Guide

## üìä **Overview**
This guide provides comprehensive insights into decoding 360¬∞ positional data and events from Euro 2024, focusing on practical applications for commentary generation and move quality prediction.

## üéØ **Key Data Structures**

### ‚è∞ **Events Data Structure**
```python
{
    'match_id': 3942819,           # Unique match identifier
    'minute': 23,                  # Match minute (0-90+)
    'second': 15,                  # Second within minute (0-59)
    'event_type': 'Pass',          # Event type (Pass, Shot, Carry, etc.)
    'player_name': 'Jude Bellingham',  # Player involved
    'team_name': 'England',        # Team name
    'home_team': 'Netherlands',    # Home team
    'away_team': 'England'         # Away team
}
```

### üéØ **360¬∞ Data Structure**
```python
{
    'event_uuid': 'uuid-string',   # Links to specific event
    'match_id': 3942819,          # Match identifier
    'visible_area': [82.1, 80.0, 37.5, 80.0],  # Camera view area
    'freeze_frame': [              # Player positions array
        {
            'teammate': True,      # Is teammate of event actor
            'actor': False,        # Is the event actor
            'keeper': True,        # Is goalkeeper
            'location': [22.7, 41.0]  # X,Y coordinates
        }
    ],
    'home_team': 'Netherlands',
    'away_team': 'England',
    'stage': 'Semi-finals'
}
```

## üîç **Decoding Process**

### 1. **Time Synchronization**
```python
# Convert to unified timestamp
events_df['timestamp_seconds'] = events_df['minute'] * 60 + events_df['second']
events_df['time_display'] = events_df['minute'].astype(str) + ':' + events_df['second'].astype(str).str.zfill(2)

# Time patterns discovered:
# - Average time between events: 1.11 seconds
# - Fastest succession: 0.00 seconds (simultaneous events)
# - Longest gap: 18.00 seconds
```

### 2. **Freeze Frame Parsing**
```python
def parse_freeze_frame(frame_str):
    """Parse freeze frame string to extract player positions"""
    players_data = ast.literal_eval(frame_str)
    
    parsed_players = []
    for player in players_data:
        parsed_player = {
            'is_teammate': player['teammate'],
            'is_actor': player['actor'],
            'is_keeper': player['keeper'],
            'x_position': player['location'][0],
            'y_position': player['location'][1]
        }
        parsed_players.append(parsed_player)
    
    return parsed_players
```

### 3. **Spatial Analysis Functions**
```python
def calculate_pressure(actor_pos, opponent_positions):
    """Calculate pressure on player (0-10 scale)"""
    distances = [math.sqrt((actor_pos[0] - opp[0])**2 + (actor_pos[1] - opp[1])**2) 
                for opp in opponent_positions]
    nearest_dist = min(distances)
    return max(0, 10 - nearest_dist)

def get_field_zone(x, y):
    """Get field zone for tactical analysis"""
    zone_x = "Defensive" if x < 40 else "Middle" if x < 80 else "Attacking"
    zone_y = "Left" if y < 26.7 else "Center" if y < 53.3 else "Right"
    return f"{zone_x} {zone_y}"
```

## üéôÔ∏è **Commentary Generation**

### **Spatial Context Templates**
```python
commentary_templates = {
    'Pass with Space': "{player} has time and space, plays it to {receiver}",
    'Pass under Pressure': "{player} under pressure from {defender}, quick ball to {receiver}",
    'Shot with Space': "{player} has space and time, {distance}m shot!",
    'Shot under Pressure': "{player} shoots under pressure from {distance}m out",
    'Counter Attack': "Quick counter! {player} breaks forward with space ahead"
}
```

### **Context Enhancement Logic**
```python
def generate_commentary(event, positions):
    player = event['player_name']
    minute = event['minute']
    event_type = event['event_type']
    
    # Calculate spatial context
    space = calculate_space_around_player(positions, player)
    pressure = calculate_pressure(positions, player)
    
    # Generate context-aware commentary
    if event_type == 'Pass' and space > 10:
        return f"{player} has time and space in minute {minute}"
    elif event_type == 'Shot' and pressure > 7:
        return f"{player} shoots under pressure in minute {minute}!"
```

## üîÆ **Move Quality Prediction**

### **Pass Quality Features**
```python
def predict_pass_quality(passer_pos, receiver_pos, opponents):
    # Distance factor (shorter passes generally easier)
    pass_distance = euclidean_distance(passer_pos, receiver_pos)
    distance_factor = max(0, 10 - pass_distance/10)
    
    # Pressure factor (more pressure = harder)
    passer_pressure = min_distance_to_opponents(passer_pos, opponents)
    pressure_factor = min(10, passer_pressure)
    
    # Space factor (more space for receiver = easier)
    receiver_space = min_distance_to_opponents(receiver_pos, opponents)
    space_factor = min(10, receiver_space)
    
    # Lane factor (fewer defenders in lane = easier)
    defenders_in_lane = count_defenders_in_passing_lane(passer_pos, receiver_pos, opponents)
    lane_factor = max(0, 10 - defenders_in_lane * 3)
    
    # Combined quality score
    quality_score = (distance_factor + pressure_factor + space_factor + lane_factor) / 4
    return quality_score
```

### **Shot Quality Features**
```python
def predict_shot_quality(shot_pos, goal_pos, gk_pos, defenders):
    # Distance to goal
    distance = euclidean_distance(shot_pos, goal_pos)
    
    # Angle to goal (wider angle = better)
    angle = calculate_goal_angle(shot_pos)
    
    # Goalkeeper position
    gk_distance = euclidean_distance(shot_pos, gk_pos)
    
    # Defensive pressure
    defender_pressure = calculate_pressure(shot_pos, defenders)
    
    return xG_model(distance, angle, gk_distance, defender_pressure)
```

## üìê **Coordinate System**

### **Field Layout**
- **X-axis**: 0-120 meters (field length)
- **Y-axis**: 0-80 meters (field width)
- **Origin**: Bottom-left corner
- **Goals**: X=0 (left goal), X=120 (right goal)
- **Goal posts**: (120, 36) and (120, 44)

### **Zone Classifications**
- **Defensive third**: X < 40
- **Middle third**: 40 ‚â§ X < 80  
- **Attacking third**: X ‚â• 80
- **Left channel**: Y < 26.7
- **Center channel**: 26.7 ‚â§ Y < 53.3
- **Right channel**: Y ‚â• 53.3

## üîó **Data Synchronization Methods**

### **Method 1: UUID Matching (Ideal)**
```python
# Direct event-to-position matching
merged_data = events_df.merge(data_360_df, on='event_uuid', how='inner')
```

### **Method 2: Time-based Matching**
```python
# Match by timestamp within same match
events_df['timestamp'] = events_df['minute'] * 60 + events_df['second']
# Requires fuzzy matching logic for closest timestamps
```

### **Method 3: Sequence Matching**
```python
# Match by event order within match
events_df['event_order'] = events_df.groupby('match_id').cumcount()
```

## üìä **Real Data Analysis Results**

## üöÄ **Practical Applications**

### **1. Real-time Commentary**
```python
# Example output:
"‚öΩ Jude Bellingham with plenty of time, looks to distribute the ball with some room to work in minute 23"
"üéØ Harry Kane shoots under intense pressure from in tight quarters - minute 67!"
"üèÉ Pedri drives forward with plenty of time in acres of space in minute 34"
```

### **2. Move Quality Scoring**
```python
# Example pass quality scores:
# Medium pass through midfield: 5.3/10 (moderate difficulty)
# Final third through ball: 5.0/10 (moderate difficulty)  
# Long diagonal switch: 4.6/10 (moderate difficulty)
```

### **3. Tactical Analysis**
```python
# Team shape metrics:
team_analysis = {
    'width': 45.2,        # Distance between widest players
    'length': 67.8,       # Distance between deepest/highest
    'compactness': 12.3,  # Average distance between players
    'defensive_line': 23.4, # Average defender Y position
    'pressure_intensity': 7.2  # Average pressure applied
}
```
