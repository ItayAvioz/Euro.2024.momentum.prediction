# Research Folder Reorganization - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully reorganized into 4 project phases

---

## 📊 Before & After

### ❌ BEFORE: Flat structure (32 files mixed together)
```
research/
├── extract_commentator_data.py
├── extract_commentator_data_simple.py
├── extract_starting_events_with_stats.py
├── extract_final_game_detailed.py
├── generate_rich_commentary.py
├── generate_event_commentary.py
├── ... (26 more files) ...
└── commentator_training_data.csv
```
**Problems:**
- Hard to navigate
- No clear project evolution
- Experimental vs production files mixed
- No context for each file's purpose

---

### ✅ AFTER: Organized by project phase

```

    ├── scripts/ (3 files)
    ├── data/ (2 CSVs - 3,312 events) ⭐
    └── docs/ (4 docs including COMPLETE GUIDE) ⭐
```

**Benefits:**
