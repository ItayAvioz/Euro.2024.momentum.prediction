# üìä NLP Commentator - Complete Datasets Description

## üéØ Overview

Two complementary datasets have been created for NLP Commentator development:

---

## üìã **Dataset 1: Action Event Sequences** 
**File**: `commentator_training_data.csv`

### Purpose
Training data for generating commentary during match action sequences.

### Specifications
- **144 events** across **30 sequences**
- **3 exciting matches** (Final, QF, R16)
- **2-5 consecutive events** per sequence
- Focus on: Goals, Shots, Dribbles, Pressure, Carries

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Sequence Context**: event_position, sequence_length, is_key_event
- ‚úÖ **Event Details**: type, player, location, outcomes
- ‚úÖ **Match Context**: teams, possession, play_pattern
- ‚úÖ **Event-specific data**: shot/pass/dribble/carry details

### Use Case
*"In the 67th minute, Yamal receives in the final third, drives forward, and threads a pass to Williams... GOAL!"*

### Columns (35 total)
1. Sequence metadata (6): sequence_id, sequence_type, sequence_key_event, event_position, sequence_length, is_key_event

## üí° **Usage Examples**

### Pre-Match Commentary (Dataset 2)
```python
# Load starting events dataset
df = pd.read_csv('starting_events_with_team_stats.csv')

# Get match 3943043 (Final) first event
final_match = df[df['match_id'] == 3943043].iloc[0]

commentary = f"""
Welcome to the {final_match['stage']} at {final_match['stadium']}!

{final_match['home_team']} comes into this match with an incredible record:
- {final_match['home_wins']} wins from {final_match['home_matches_played']} matches
- {final_match['home_goals_scored']} goals scored, only {final_match['home_goals_conceded']} conceded
- Last match: {final_match['home_last_result']} vs {final_match['home_last_opponent']} ({final_match['home_last_score']})

{final_match['away_team']} have battled through:
- {final_match['away_wins']} wins, {final_match['away_draws']} draws from {final_match['away_matches_played']} matches
- Last match: {final_match['away_last_result']} vs {final_match['away_last_opponent']} ({final_match['away_last_score']})

Referee: {final_match['referee']}
Final Score: {final_match['home_team']} {final_match['home_score']}-{final_match['away_score']} {final_match['away_team']}
"""
```

**Output**:
```
Welcome to the Final at Olympiastadion Berlin!

Spain comes into this match with an incredible record:
- 6 wins from 6 matches
- 13 goals scored, only 3 conceded
- Last match: Win vs France (2-1)

England have battled through:
- 3 wins, 3 draws from 6 matches
- Last match: Win vs Netherlands (2-1)

Referee: Fran√ßois Letexier
Final Score: Spain 2-1 England
```

### Action Commentary (Dataset 1)
```python
# Load action sequences dataset
df = pd.read_csv('commentator_training_data.csv')

# Get a goal sequence
goal_seq = df[df['sequence_type'] == 'shot_sequence']
goal_seq = goal_seq[goal_seq['sequence_id'] == 15]  # Example sequence

# Build commentary from sequence
events = []
for _, event in goal_seq.iterrows():
    player = eval(event['player'])['name'].split()[-1]
    event_type = eval(event['type'])['name']
    minute = event['minute']
    
    if event['is_key_event']:
        events.append(f"**{player} {event_type.upper()}! In the {minute}th minute!**")
    else:
        events.append(f"{player} {event_type.lower()}")

commentary = " ‚Üí ".join(events)
```

## üéØ **Next Steps for NLP Development**

### Phase 1: Data Preparation ‚úÖ
- [x] Extract action sequences (Dataset 1)
- [x] Extract starting events with stats (Dataset 2)
- [x] Include team form and context

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Current)
- [ ] Parse all JSON fields (type, player, team, location)
- [ ] Convert coordinates to natural language
- [ ] Create commentary templates
- [ ] Integrate momentum predictions

### Phase 3: Model Training (Planned)
- [ ] Build baseline rule-based system
- [ ] Train sequence-to-sequence model
- [ ] Fine-tune on football commentary style
- [ ] Evaluate with BLEU/ROUGE scores

### Phase 4: Integration (Planned)
- [ ] Combine pre-match + action commentary
- [ ] Add real-time momentum context
- [ ] Create commentary API
- [ ] Test with live data simulation
