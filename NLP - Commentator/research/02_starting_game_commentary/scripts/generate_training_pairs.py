    1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
       - Input: All columns except 'commentary'

       - Model learns to generate natural language from structured data
    
    2. TEMPLATE-BASED GENERATION
       - Extract patterns from commentary
       - Learn conditional rules (debut vs experienced teams)
       - Apply to new data
    
    3. FEATURE IMPORTANCE
       - Identify which stats are most mentioned
       - Determine narrative priorities
       - Optimize data extraction
    
    4. EVALUATION METRICS
       - BLEU score (n-gram overlap)
       - ROUGE score (summary quality)
       - Human evaluation (fluency, accuracy)
