## ✅ What We Created

### 1. **Final Game Data Extraction & Enrichment**
   **File:** `extract_final_game_detailed.py`

   - Extracts all events from Spain vs England final, minute 75 onwards (525 events)
   - Calculates tournament stats for both teams (BEFORE the final)
   - Tracks player tournament goals (before final)
   - Dynamically tracks in-match score and player stats
   - Enriches every event with 42 data fields

   **Tournament Stats Calculated:**
   - **Spain:** 6-0-0 record, 13 goals scored, 3 conceded
   - **England:** 3-3-0 record, 7 goals scored, 4 conceded
   - **Top Scorers:** Daniel Olmo (3), Jude Bellingham (3), Harry Kane (3), etc.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Load Data:
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('final_game_rich_commentary.csv')
print(f"Loaded {len(df)} events from {df['minute'].min()}-{df['minute'].max()} minutes")
```

### Find Goals:
```python
goals = df[df['is_goal'] == True]
for _, goal in goals.iterrows():
    print(f"\n[{goal['minute']}:{int(goal['second']):02d}] GOAL!")
    print(goal['event_commentary'])
```

### Analyze Sequences:
```python
for seq_id in df['sequence_id'].unique():
    seq = df[df['sequence_id'] == seq_id]
    print(f"\n{'='*80}")
    print(f"Sequence {seq_id} ({len(seq)} events)")
    print(seq.iloc[0]['sequence_commentary'])
```

### Get Key Moments:
```python
key_events = df[df['event_type'].isin(['Shot', 'Block', 'Goal Keeper'])]
for _, event in key_events.iterrows():
    print(f"[{event['minute']}:{int(event['second']):02d}] {event['event_commentary']}")
```

### Tournament Stats:
```python
spain_stats = df[df['team_name'] == 'Spain'].iloc[0]
print(f"Spain (before final): {spain_stats['team_tournament_wins']}-{spain_stats['team_tournament_draws']}-{spain_stats['team_tournament_losses']}")
print(f"Goals: {spain_stats['team_tournament_goals']} scored, {spain_stats['team_tournament_conceded']} conceded")
```

   - Score-aware commentary (comeback vs. extending lead)
   - Zone-aware descriptions (attacking third = more detail)

### 3. **Natural Language Variation:**
   - Multiple ways to describe same action
   - Conditional logic based on context
   - Excitement modulation based on event importance

### 4. **Sequence Narratives:**
   - Groups related events
