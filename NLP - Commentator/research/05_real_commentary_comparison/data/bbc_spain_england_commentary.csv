spain_england,3,0,3,"Spain keeper Unai Simon has touched the ball more than anyone else so far.",general,General,Simon,Spain,76

spain_england,5,0,5,"Spain are starting to show their attacking intent. Marc Cucurella is out wide deep inside England's half but he is forced back.",general,General,Cucurella,Spain,141
spain_england,6,0,6,"Neat and tidy by Spain. England are yet to mount a serious attack.",general,General,,Both,71
spain_england,7,0,7,"Good defending by Kyle Walker and then Declan Rice as Nico Williams looks to pounce inside the penalty area. England look solid at the back but we've seen nothing from them in terms of an attacking threat.",general,General,"Walker, Rice, Williams",England,213
spain_england,9,0,9,"England are trying to break forward and Jude Bellingham wins a free-kick inside Spain's half after a foul by Rodri. This is in a decent position.",general,Free Kick,"Bellingham, Rodri",England,157

spain_england,12,0,12,"Oh, that's outstanding by John Stones. A super challenge by the England defender to thwart Nico Williams who has started really strongly. Williams looks Spain's biggest threat at the moment.",general,General,"Stones, Williams",England,203
spain_england,13,0,13,"Half a chance for Robin Le Normand but it drops well wide.",general,General,Le Normand,Spain,63

spain_england,16,0,16,"England are stepping it up! Bukayo Saka is posing a threat and threads a nice pass to Declan Rice who lets fly. It's blocked. England are looking much more lively.",general,General,"Saka, Rice",England,173

spain_england,20,0,20,"And just like that 20 minutes gone in a flash. Nothing for England to be seriously concerned about so far.",general,General,,England,116
spain_england,22,0,22,"Danger for England. Phil Foden gives the ball away just outside his own penalty area and Dani Olmo tries to tee up Lamine Yamal who cannot find the target.",general,General,"Foden, Olmo, Yamal",England,166
spain_england,25,0,25,"Luke Shaw looks really sharp and is getting into some decent positions. Now Harry Kane has gone in late on Fabian Ruiz and is shown a yellow card. That's England's 12th booking of the tournament - Kane has two.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Shaw, Kane, Ruiz",England,223

spain_england,34,0,34,"Tow quick corners for Spain. The second is half cleared to Dani Olmo who lines up a shot but it's blocked. Jordan Pickford has still to be seriously tested.",general,Corner,"Olmo, Pickford",Spain,168
spain_england,37,0,37,"Lamine Yamal has the ball out wide deep inside England's half. He attempts to deliver it into the box but Luke Shaw is in the right place to clear. Shaw has hardly put a foot wrong.",general,General,"Yamal, Shaw",Spain,189

spain_england,42,0,42,"Now Spain captain Alvaro Morata wins a corner after a good piece of defending by John Stones. It doesn't come to anything. Fair to say this hasn't been a classic.",general,Corner,"Morata, Stones",Spain,173

spain_england,46,0,46,"First blood to Spain! England are undone 69 seconds into the second half. It's a lovely move with Lamine Yamal at the centre of it. It falls to Nico Williams free inside the box and he steers it beyond Jordan Pickford.",key_event,Goal,"Williams, Yamal, Pickford",Spain,242
spain_england,48,0,48,"Almost a second for Spain! England have not turned up this half. This time a chance for Dani Olmo but he snaps at it and it goes wide.",key_event,Shot,Olmo,Spain,151

spain_england,51,0,51,"England have to go for it now! Still just the one attempt on target.",general,General,,England,75

spain_england,55,0,55,"This doesn't look good. England are all over the place! After John Stones makes a vital clearance, Nico Williams goes for goal and it's just wide. England are giving the ball away so cheaply.",key_event,Shot,"Stones, Williams",Spain,203
spain_england,56,0,56,"There is only one team in this - and it's not England.",general,General,,Spain,61
spain_england,57,0,57,"It looks like England are about to make a change. Gareth Southgate needs to do something - it's too easy for Spain.",general,General,Southgate,England,127

spain_england,60,0,60,"Harry Kane passes the armband to Kyle Walker before making way for Ollie Watkins. England fans respond with a roar. That's a positive change as far as they are concerned.",key_event,Substitution,"Kane, Walker, Watkins",England,192
spain_england,62,0,62,"That's very late! Nico Williams on Bukayo Saka and England have a free-kick out wide deep inside Spain's half. Phil Foden is going to whip this in.",general,Free Kick,"Williams, Saka, Foden",England,169
spain_england,62,0,62,"That's another disappointing delivery. Easily cleared.",general,Free Kick,,England,59
spain_england,63,0,63,"Oh, my. Wow. That's the best we have seen of Jude Bellingham in this final. He turns his marker on the edge of the box and creates space for himself before drilling it towards the net. Wide.",key_event,Shot,Bellingham,England,208
spain_england,65,0,65,"Turn away now England fans.",general,General,,England,28
spain_england,67,0,67,"Lamine Yamal doing Lamine Yamal things. The 17-year-old creates space for himself outside the box and fires towards the net only for Jordan Pickford to push it behind. Pickford keeps England in this.",key_event,Save,"Yamal, Pickford",Spain,214
spain_england,69,0,69,"Spain have replaced captain Alvaro Morata with Mikel Oyarzabal.",key_event,Substitution,"Morata, Oyarzabal",Spain,69

spain_england,72,0,72,"ICEEEEEE COLD PALMER! What a finish by Cole Palmer. He equalises with a finish from about 22 yards out - low and hard beyond Unai Simon. Gareth Southgate punches the air. England are back in it!",key_event,Goal,"Palmer, Simon, Southgate",England,225
spain_england,74,0,74,"Another substitute rides to England's rescue. A beautiful finish by Cole Palmer! He celebrated it with a trademark salute.",general,General,Palmer,England,128

spain_england,86,0,86,"Agony for England! Mikel Oyarzabal stretches to meet Marc Cucurella's low cross into the box and steer it past Jordan Pickford. Was he offside? No! England have four minutes plus stoppages to save this.",key_event,Goal,"Oyarzabal, Cucurella, Pickford",Spain,228
