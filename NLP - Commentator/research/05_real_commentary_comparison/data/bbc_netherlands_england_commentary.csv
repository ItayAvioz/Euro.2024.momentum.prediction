netherlands_england,2,0,2,"The Netherlands win a free-kick inside the opening 20 seconds. A long ball forward and Donyell Malen is trying to reach it but he's offside.",general,Offside,Malen,Netherlands,154
netherlands_england,3,0,3,"Jude Bellingham is tussling for the ball with Xavi Simons in the centre circle. Tonight could be a good battle between the two 21-year-olds. It's a slow and steady start from both sides.",general,General,"Bellingham, Simons",Both,200
netherlands_england,4,0,4,"Nice move by England involving Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane before the ball is played out wide to Bukayo Saka who sends in a cross which is headed away.",general,General,"Bellingham, Kane, Saka",England,172
netherlands_england,6,0,6,"Great work by Bukayo Saka to steal the ball off Cody Gakpo out wide on the halfway line but England cannot make it count.",general,General,"Saka, Gakpo",England,140
netherlands_england,6,0,6,"That's a rocket! No wonder they are saying good things about Xavi Simons. He wins the ball off Declan Rice and from the edge of the box unleashes an unstoppable finish into the net. Jordan Pickford dives in an attempt to keep it out but he wasn't getting to that.",key_event,Goal,"Simons, Rice, Pickford",Netherlands,277
netherlands_england,9,0,9,"Time for cool heads. England been behind before at this tournament but they have serious work to do.",general,General,,England,109
netherlands_england,11,0,11,"Bukayo Saka wins a free-kick inside the Dutch half after being shoved to the floor by Cody Gakpo. By the way, Saka has been one of England's better players so far.",general,Free Kick,"Saka, Gakpo",England,174
netherlands_england,13,0,13,"That goal was timed at 6:41. The Netherlands have avoided defeat in their last four matches when scoring first in the European Championship, since a 2-1 loss to Portugal in 2012.",general,General,,Netherlands,187
netherlands_england,14,0,14,"SO CLOSE! Good work by Bukayo Saka leads to an attempt by Harry Kane which flashes agonisingly over. Kane is hurt after connecting with Denzel Dumfries while getting his shot away.",key_event,Shot,"Saka, Kane, Dumfries",England,203
netherlands_england,15,0,15,"Oh, hello! Have England won a penalty?",key_event,VAR,,England,46

netherlands_england,18,0,18,"As cool as you like! He's been criticised, he's been told he's not playing well enough...but Harry Kane has got England back on level terms. Great penalty.",key_event,Goal,Kane,England,166
netherlands_england,19,0,19,"Danny Murphy has just said that penalty wouldn't have been awarded in the Premier League. Who cares?",general,General,,Both,109

netherlands_england,23,0,23,"The Netherlands are on the ropes! Phil Foden wiggles free inside the Netherlands box and looks to have done all the hard work but his final attempt does not fully cross the line and it is hacked clear.",key_event,Shot,Foden,England,214
netherlands_england,24,0,24,"THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER. England fans have waited a long time for this type of performance. England are going for it and they look dangerous with every attack.",general,General,,England,167
netherlands_england,27,0,27,"Three attempts on target by England. They're a lot more livelier. They would be ahead too but for Denzel Dumfries' clearance off the line to deny Phil Foden.",general,General,"Dumfries, Foden",England,171
netherlands_england,29,0,29,"Phil Foden is causing all sorts of problems. He thinks he is about to burst clean through but is fouled by Denzel Dumfries, who is already on a booking. The referee doesn't see it.",general,General,"Foden, Dumfries",England,196
netherlands_england,29,0,29,"This is action-packed. You cannot take your eyes off it. Denzel Dumfries is everywhere! Now he clatters the bar with a powerful header.",key_event,Shot,Dumfries,Netherlands,157

netherlands_england,34,0,34,"What's this? A huge blow for the Netherlands as Memphis Depay is forced off with an injury. On comes Joey Veerman.",key_event,Substitution,"Depay, Veerman",Netherlands,137
netherlands_england,35,0,35,"They're outnumbered but they're making all the noise. It's fair to say England's fans are encouraged by what they are seeing.",general,General,,England,137
netherlands_england,37,0,37,"Where has this half gone? It's flown by. Two teams who are really going for it. Two teams who really want to play Spain in Sunday's final.",general,General,,Both,150
netherlands_england,39,0,39,"Cheeky by Kobbie Mainoo! A back-heel from the 19-year-old for Phil Foden who goes for goal. Bart Verbruggen makes the save. Where have England been hiding? They seriously look in the mood tonight.",general,General,"Mainoo, Foden, Verbruggen",England,213
netherlands_england,41,0,41,"Kobbie Mainoo is a joy to watch when he plays like this. A flick here, a flick there. The teenager is right at the heart of England's best moves.",general,General,Mainoo,England,159

netherlands_england,45,0,45,"England are ending the half strongly. Kieran Trippier tries to find Phil Foden, who is lurking inside the six-yard area, with a cross.

netherlands_england,45,0,45,"Three additional minutes at the end of the first half.",general,General,,Both,58
netherlands_england,45,1,45+1,"I don't think England want this half to end. The reaction to falling behind has been excellent. Gareth Southgate will feel his side should really be leading.",general,General,Southgate,England,168

netherlands_england,51,0,51,"It's very stop-start in the early stages of the second half. There's more excitement in the stands than on the pitch. England fans have not stopped singing all match.",general,General,,England,182
netherlands_england,52,0,52,"England are controlling the ball well. Luke Shaw is already trying to influence the game. The substitute tries to pick out Harry Kane with a cross but it's blocked.",general,General,"Shaw, Kane",England,174
netherlands_england,53,0,53,"Declan Rice escapes a yellow card after a clear foul. This is highly competitive but there has only been one booking so far to Denzel Dumfries.",general,General,"Rice, Dumfries",England,161
netherlands_england,56,0,56,"A crucial stage of this semi-final. Both teams look scared to make a mistake. This isn't being played at anywhere near the same tempo as the first half. That can all change in a flash, of course.",general,General,,Both,200
netherlands_england,58,0,58,"Here come England through Jude Bellingham. A beautiful turn by Phil Foden but Harry Kane cannot keep possession.",general,General,"Bellingham, Foden, Kane",England,134
netherlands_england,60,0,60,"We've reached the hour mark. Too early to start talking about extra-time?",general,General,,Both,81
netherlands_england,62,0,62,"What has happened to this game? It was action-packed, edge of your seat stuff in the first 45 minutes. Nothing like that this half.",general,General,,Both,141
netherlands_england,65,0,65,"Jordan Pickford to the rescue! A set-piece for the Dutch and it's curled into the England box and Virgil van Dijk times his run to perfection.

netherlands_england,67,0,67,"Wout Weghorst has made a couple of naughty challenges since coming on. Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden are not seeing the ball as much as they did in the first half.",general,General,"Weghorst, Saka, Foden",Both,171
netherlands_england,68,0,68,"The Dutch are whipping in cross after cross into the England box. Jordan Pickford has to stretch to put the latest one out for a corner. England have not been able to get going at all this half.",general,General,Pickford,Netherlands,200
netherlands_england,70,0,70,"Twenty minutes from extra-time. Still just the one change by Gareth Southgate.",general,General,Southgate,England,91
netherlands_england,71,0,71,"It's all a bit flat as far as England are concerned. They were exciting, entertaining and threatening in the first half. Nothing like that this half.",general,General,,England,158
netherlands_england,72,0,72,"That's going to hurt! Jude Bellingham goes in VERY late on Stefan de Vrij and get a yellow card. Fair play to De Vrij for not making a big deal of that.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Bellingham, de Vrij",England,175
netherlands_england,73,0,73,"Nine yellow cards for England at Euro 2024. Jude Bellingham has two of them.",general,General,Bellingham,England,83

netherlands_england,77,0,77,"Another good move by the Dutch and it ends with a snatched shot by Xavi Simons straight at Jordan Pickford. England are on the back-foot for now.",general,General,"Simons, Pickford",Netherlands,159
netherlands_england,77,0,77,"Double England change coming up. Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins.",key_event,Substitution,"Palmer, Watkins",England,67
netherlands_england,79,0,79,"England have the ball in the back of the net! Bukayo Saka finishes off a great move from close range but the offside flag goes up straight away. It was tight...",key_event,VAR,Saka,England,167
netherlands_england,81,0,81,"This is it Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins. It's your time to shine. Harry Kane has come off as has Phil Foden.",key_event,Substitution,"Kane, Foden, Palmer, Watkins",England,135
netherlands_england,82,0,82,"This is a big moment for Ollie Watkins. He has played only 20 minutes at this tournament but he now gets the chance to put his name up in lights.",general,General,Watkins,England,158
netherlands_england,84,0,84,"A lightning break by the Netherlands. It looks like they have carved open England's defence and Wout Weghorst looks set to score until Marc Guehi saves the day with an incredible challenge.",key_event,Shot,"Weghorst, Guehi",Netherlands,203
netherlands_england,85,0,85,"Five minutes of normal time left. The Netherlands look the more likely to score.",general,General,,Netherlands,92

netherlands_england,90,0,90,"He's done itttttttttttttt! OLLIE WATKINS! Sensational scenes as the substitute surely wins it for England.

netherlands_england,90,1,90+1,"Talk about impact substitutions! Cole Palmer with the assist, Ollie Watkins with the finish. We're into three minutes of additional time at the end of the second half.",general,General,"Palmer, Watkins",England,171
