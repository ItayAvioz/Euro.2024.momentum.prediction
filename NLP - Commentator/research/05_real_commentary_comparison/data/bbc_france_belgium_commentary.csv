france_belgium,1,0,1,"Kevin de Bruyne v Kylian Mbappe. Two superstars, who will guide their team to the quarter-finals? Away we go in this enticing last-16 match up.",key_event,Kick Off,"de Bruyne, Mbappe",Both,152
france_belgium,2,0,2,"Adrien Rabiot has a bit of a hit and hope effort in these early stages. Hooked with his left foot well wide of the Belgium goal.",general,General,Rabiot,France,139
france_belgium,4,0,4,"Wout Faes sends one into the area but it's straight back out by France centre back William Saliba. Remember, these two sides have scored four goals between them so far at this tournament. It doesn't exactly spell goal fest.",general,General,"Faes, Saliba",Belgium,222
france_belgium,7,0,7,"It's a cagey start from both sides in Dusseldorf. Kylian Mbappe looks to play a little one-two with Antoine Griezmann but it's snuffed out by the Belgian defence. Marcus Thuram wants a free-kick after a bit of a tussle with Arthur Theate but the referee says no.",general,General,"Mbappe, Griezmann, Thuram, Theate",Both,265
france_belgium,10,0,10,"Is it possible for us to get through 90 minutes of football without talking about England? I get it. But can we just not for a bit.",general,General,,Both,129
france_belgium,10,0,10,"Antoine Griezmann has a shot from just outside the area but it's a really tame effort and an easy collection for Koen Casteels. Kylian Mbappe is fuming on the left-hand side, he wanted to have a go himself.",general,General,"Griezmann, Casteels, Mbappe",France,217
france_belgium,12,0,12,"The past five minutes or so have been played pretty much in the Belgian half. Jules Kounde looks to cut it back from the byline but there's no one there running onto it.",general,General,Kounde,France,173
france_belgium,14,0,14,"Antoine Griezmann sends a curling ball into the area but it's a bit too deep for Kylian Mbappe. Timothy Castagne heads behind anyway to prevent the danger. France have a corner.",general,Corner,"Griezmann, Mbappe, Castagne",France,190
france_belgium,16,0,16,"Now then. Kylian Mbappe has a chance just inside the area from the corner but his effort balloons over the bar. It looks like it takes a little deflection off the head of Amadou Onana and Aurelien Tchouameni finds himself in the book for having a go at the referee. He thought it was a handball.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Mbappe, Onana, Tchouameni",France,296
france_belgium,18,0,18,"Marcus Thuram heads well wide from a France corner. Les Bleus are certainly the more dominant at the moment but there's been nothing particularly clear-cut.",general,Corner,Thuram,France,160
france_belgium,22,0,22,"Aurelien Tchouameni loops the cross in but it's high and Marcus Thuram can only head up into the Dusseldorf sky before Koen Casteels leaps to catch. Cagey is the word.",general,General,"Tchouameni, Thuram, Casteels",France,177
france_belgium,24,0,24,"It's a bit of an understatement that, Izzy. Antoine Griezmann goes into the book for a foul on Jeremy Doku. It's right on the edge of the area and puts the Manchester City man off getting a clear shot off.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Griezmann, Doku",France,216
france_belgium,27,0,27,"Kevin de Bruyne, making his 105th Belgium appearance, sends it in and it's not a bad effort. Mike Maignan has to make the save. A bit of a strange one with his feet.",key_event,Save,"de Bruyne, Maignan",Belgium,173
france_belgium,27,0,27,"Goodness me. Adrien Rabiot is the latest French player into the referee's book. It's a late challenge on Jeremy Doku and it looks like a sore one. That means the midfielder will miss the quarter-final, should France make it through.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Rabiot, Doku",France,240
france_belgium,30,0,30,"Belgium are just starting to enjoy a bit of the ball themselves. France are sitting very deep which makes for...how to put this...not very entertaining football.",general,General,,Both,166
france_belgium,33,0,33,"The fans, not sure which set, seem to be singing ""don't take me home"" in English. Seems an intriguing choice. Firstly because they're singing it in English, secondly given the quality of this game. Perhaps Gary can provide some insight.",general,General,,Both,241
france_belgium,35,0,35,"That's a big chance. A brilliant cross in from Jules Kounde on the right-hand side but Marcus Thuram can't get his effort on target.",key_event,Shot,"Kounde, Thuram",France,147
france_belgium,37,0,37,"Another half-decent cross. This time it's from Theo Hernandez on the left but Koen Casteels has it covered.",general,General,"Hernandez, Casteels",France,123
france_belgium,40,0,40,"Aurelien Tchouameni has a go from distance but it's just wide. There was some power on it but no accuracy. Five minutes to go until half time.",general,General,Tchouameni,France,151
france_belgium,41,0,41,"Belgium have not had a shot on target so far in this game. France have had one.",general,General,,Both,85
france_belgium,43,0,43,"Clever play from France in the pockets around the Belgian penalty area. Antoine Griezmann rushes the ball in and it's too far ahead of Marcus Thuram for the Inter Milan forward to get anything on it.",general,General,"Griezmann, Thuram",France,203
france_belgium,45,0,45,"Kylian Mbappe and Jeremy Doku are locked in a bit of a battle just inside the penalty area but the Frenchman stays on his feet and finds Aurelien Tchouameni who has another blast from distance but it's again off target.",general,General,"Mbappe, Doku, Tchouameni",France,230
france_belgium,45,3,45+3,"No added time at the end of the half. Understandable. Goalless at the break.",general,Half Time,,Both,83
france_belgium,46,0,46,"Off we go. No changes for either side.",key_event,Kick Off,,Both,43
france_belgium,47,0,47,"Aurélien Tchouaméni has not been shy to have a pop from range tonight and here he goes again. He drives low with his right foot and it's probably the best effort we've seen so far from the Real Madrid man. Koen Casteels made the save down to his left.",general,General,"Tchouameni, Casteels",France,256
france_belgium,51,0,51,"France have a free-kick but it's a disappointing delivery from Antoine Griezmann. It's headed back out to Jules Kounde but there's another chance gone begging from Marcus Thuram. He mistimes his header it skies over the bar. It looks like it actually comes off his shoulder.",general,Free Kick,"Griezmann, Kounde, Thuram",France,276
france_belgium,53,0,53,"So many quality players on the pitch. Not much quality between them on show here.",general,General,,Both,93
france_belgium,54,0,54,"Kylian Mbappe twists and turns and breezes past two Belgium defenders. He shifts onto his right foot and shoots from just inside the area, looking for the far corner but his effort is just over. Well that would've woken this game up.",key_event,Shot,Mbappe,France,242
france_belgium,56,0,56,"France are just starting to probe now. Antoine Griezmann cuts it back for Kylian Mbappe who looks to just tuck it into the bottom corner but it's miles wide.",general,General,"Griezmann, Mbappe",France,167
france_belgium,57,0,57,"It's been a mildly more entertaining second half. But I do mean mildly. France have now had 13 shots, two on target. Lacking that clinical final product.",general,General,,France,164
france_belgium,60,0,60,"Jeremy Doku is getting a bit frustrated. He seems to be one of the only ones trying to up the tempo of this game. I feel like I've barely mentioned Romelu Lukaku and that just tells you everything really. How long before we see some changes?",general,General,"Doku, Lukaku",Belgium,248
france_belgium,61,0,61,"The whole Belgium end must've been shouting ""shoooot!"" at Yannick Carrasco just now. Kevin de Bruyne threads through a lovely pass but Theo Hernandez does enough to prevent Carrasco getting the shot off. Brilliant defending but perhaps Carrasco could've taken it a bit sooner.",general,General,"Carrasco, de Bruyne, Hernandez",Belgium,292
france_belgium,62,0,62,"France are going to make a change. Marcus Thuram makes way for Randal Kolo Muani. A game to forget for the Inter Milan forward.",key_event,Substitution,"Thuram, Kolo Muani",France,150
france_belgium,64,0,64,"Belgium are also going to make a change. On comes Orel Mangala for Lois Openda. It's a defensive substitution and it looks like Kevin de Bruyne is just going to shift up the pitch a little bit.",key_event,Substitution,"Openda, Mangala, de Bruyne",Belgium,206
france_belgium,66,0,66,"Antoine Griezmann has a go from the edge of the area. It's wide. It's not happening this, is it? There's 25 minutes remaining for either side to prevent extra time. At this point I think it would only take one goal.",general,General,Griezmann,France,220
france_belgium,70,0,70,"Antoine Griezmann lays it off for Aurelien Tchouameni, who is arriving on the edge of the area, but he balloons it over the bar. That's 16 efforts off target.",general,General,"Griezmann, Tchouameni",France,170
france_belgium,71,0,71,"That's a first effort on goal from Romelu Lukaku and a first real save that Mike Maignan has had to make. Lukaku finds himself in a decent position and hits a low drive towards the bottom corner but the French keeper parries away.",key_event,Save,"Lukaku, Maignan",Belgium,238
france_belgium,72,0,72,"Jeremy Doku sits on the pitch with his hands on the pitch as he tussles with Aurelien Tchouameni and the referee awards France a corner. The Manchester City man isn't happy but replays show it's the right decision.",general,Corner,"Doku, Tchouameni",France,216
france_belgium,75,0,75,"William Saliba has seen enough from his position in the back line and decides to have a crack from range. It's a lovely effort but, surprise surprise, it's off target.",general,General,Saliba,France,172
france_belgium,78,0,78,"Oh. Jan Vertonghen goes into the book after getting himself in a tangle with Randal Kolo Muani. I thought it was the other way round, to be honest with the France player bringing down the Belgian defender. Looks like there's also a yellow card for Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco. He wasn't happy with that decision either.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Vertonghen, Kolo Muani, Tedesco",Belgium,338
france_belgium,80,0,80,"Another good chance for Kylian Mbappe. Hit with power and a decent whip. Wide.",general,General,Mbappe,France,85
france_belgium,84,0,84,"Ohhh that was a huge chance for Belgium! Belgium get on the counter and Kevin de Bruyne drives through the middle and hits a powerful strike low and hard but Mike Maignan makes the save. The Manchester City midfielder has his head in his hands. What an opportunity.",key_event,Save,"de Bruyne, Maignan",Belgium,268
france_belgium,85,0,85,"The game has finally started to open up and it's going to have to if we are to avoid extra time.",general,General,,Both,102
france_belgium,85,0,85,"Breakthrough! France win the ball back deep in their own half and it's a good bit of play from them to work the ball into the penalty area. It comes to Randal Kolo Muani, who lets fly and it takes a deflection off Jan Vertonghen's knee and wrong foots keeper Koen Casteels. It's absolute bedlam as the France bench flood the pitch to celebrate with their teammates. Cruel for Belgium.",key_event,Goal,"Kolo Muani, Vertonghen, Casteels",France,408
france_belgium,86,0,86,"The goal has actually gone down as an own goal for Jan Vertonghen. Ouch. Randal Kolo Muani's effort wouldn't have been on target.",general,Goal,"Vertonghen, Kolo Muani",France,138
france_belgium,89,0,89,"One minute of normal time remains. Is there another chance in this? Kevin de Bruyne will be having nightmares about that chance tonight.",general,General,de Bruyne,Belgium,145
france_belgium,90,0,90,"Half a chance for Belgium as Orel Mangala looks for Romelu Lukaku in the middle of the area but it won't fall for him.",general,General,"Mangala, Lukaku",Belgium,132
france_belgium,90,1,90+1,"We'll have three minutes added on. Charles De Ketelaere and Dodi Lukebakio are on for Timothy Castagne and Yannick Carrasco.",key_event,Substitution,"Castagne, Carrasco, De Ketelaere, Lukebakio",Belgium,144
france_belgium,90,1,90+1,"Are we seeing the final few minutes of Belgium's golden generation?",general,General,,Belgium,75
france_belgium,90,2,90+2,"That goal going down as an own goal means France are still yet to score from open play at Euro 2024.",general,General,,France,104
france_belgium,90,2,90+2,"Jeremy Doku looks to find some room on the left-hand side but his cross is blocked by Dayot Upamecano. Belgium have a late corner.",general,Corner,"Doku, Upamecano",Belgium,143
france_belgium,90,3,90+3,"The corner comes to nothing. It's now or never for Belgium. Final few seconds of stoppage time.",general,Corner,,Belgium,106
france_belgium,90,3,90+3,"Orel Mangala goes into the book for dragging down Randal Kolo Muani, who had got on a run. He had to do that.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Mangala, Kolo Muani",Belgium,127
france_belgium,90,4,90+4,"That is that. France are into the Euro quarter-finals!",key_event,Full Time,,France,59
