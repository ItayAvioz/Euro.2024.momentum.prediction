final,7,0,7,"Pass, pass, pass from Spain, who have been the better outfit in the first seven minutes. England, though, are not overly concerned at this moment in time. Cagey start here.",general,General,,Both,172
final,9,0,9,"England have not yet managed to break clear, but the opportunity will be there at some stage, as Spain are pushing really high. No doubt that La Roja have started the better here, with Williams looking dangerous down the left. Ruiz has also been impressive in midfield.",general,General,"Ruiz, Williams",Both,269
final,11,0,11,"England deliver a deep free kick into the Spain box, but Guehi pushes Rodri to the ground, and Spain are able to gather control of the ball once again here.",general,Free Kick,"Guehi, Rodri",Spain,156

final,22,0,22,Some thoughts from Senior Reporter Ben Knapton...,general,Analysis,,Both,49
final,22,0,22,"""Unlike the semi-final, this has been a much more tentative start from the Three Lions, who have conceded the lion's share of possession to Spain, albeit while defending resolutely - John Stones and Declan Rice have done their bits to snuff out attacks. While Nico Williams is looking lively on the left, Lamine Yamal is yet to get the better of Luke Shaw, making his first England start in over 12 months. Southgate's risky call is paying off so far, but this one is still waiting to explode into life.""",general,General,"Stones, Shaw, Rice, Yamal, Williams",Both,504

final,27,0,27,"Mainoo is throwing his weight around in midfield at the moment, with the Manchester United youngster starting to make his mark, but he is up against two wonderful players in the shape of Rodri and Ruiz.

final,55,0,55,"""How a few minutes can make all the difference in football! Optimism may have been rife among England fans when Rodri failed to emerge for the second half, but Spain's wing wizards live up to the hype. Yamal - now on four assists for the tournament - expertly let the ball run across his body before picking out the untracked run of Williams, who did what Williams does.
