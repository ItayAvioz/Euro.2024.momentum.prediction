portugal_france,3,0,3,"Decent start from France here. The Blues are on the front foot, with Portugal having to sit deep in the early exchanges. Griezmann is playing as the 10, as expected.",general,General,Griezmann,France,161
portugal_france,5,0,5,"Little bit of possession from Portugal in the last couple of minutes. Martinez's side will be looking to settle into this contest. Ronaldo has an early touch and zips a pass into the feet of Mendes, who advances down the left. It is worked into the France box, but the Blues stand strong and manage to force Portugal back.",general,General,"Ronaldo, Mendes, Martinez",Portugal,302
portugal_france,7,0,7,"France came out quickly, but Portugal have been on top in the last few minutes, working the ball from side to side in a bid to create space. France are sitting deep at the moment.",general,General,,Both,173
portugal_france,9,0,9,"Leao and Mendes have been bright for Portugal in the early moments, and they again combine down the left, but France clear the danger. Portugal are the team dominating the ball at this moment in time.",general,General,"Leao, Mendes",Portugal,187
portugal_france,11,0,11,"Not too much from either Ronaldo or Mbappe thus far. Ronaldo has shown some nice touches, though, with the 39-year-old combining with teammates in dangerous positions. Portugal have just had a corner courtesy of a deflected Fernandes free kick, but France deal with the danger. Yet to really take off this game.",general,Corner,"Ronaldo, Mbappe, Fernandes",Both,306

portugal_france,14,0,14,"Not too much happening at the moment in all honesty. I gave this one the big build-up, but it is yet to produce.",general,General,,Both,116

portugal_france,28,0,28,"I cannot speak from personal experience, but that mask must be really difficult to play in. It simply must have an impact on Mbappe's performances.

portugal_france,37,0,37,Saliba has been excellent in the middle of the France defence tonight. He was probably the best centre-back in the Premier League last season.,general,General,Saliba,France,140
portugal_france,39,0,39,"Little over five minutes of the first period remaining, and we are goalless here. There has not been any serious chances for either side, just half-chances at absolute best. It is the match that I thought it would be. Nothing to choose between them.",general,General,,Both,234
portugal_france,41,0,41,"It will be very interesting to see how Martinez uses Ronaldo tonight. Will he face a tough decision in the second period?
