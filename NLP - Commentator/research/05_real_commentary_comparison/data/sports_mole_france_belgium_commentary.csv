3941019,2,0,2,"Early on, France put a half-chance wide, as Rabiot prods the ball several yards to the left of Casteels' goal. It was a tough volley to execute, in all fairness to the Juventus midfielder.",general,General,"Rabiot, Casteels",France,195
3941019,4,0,4,"Interestingly, six players that started the 2018 World Cup semi-final between these nations also start in Germany today: Mbappe, Kante and Griezmann for France; De Bruyne, Lukaku and Vertonghen for Belgium.",general,General,"Mbappe, Kante, Griezmann, De Bruyne, Lukaku, Vertonghen",Both,204
3941019,6,0,6,"France are enjoying their first sustained spell of pressure, but it all dies out when Thuram tries to win a free kick from Theate on the right byline and his claims are quickly dismissed by the referee.",general,General,"Thuram, Theate",France,187
3941019,8,0,8,"This is just the second time Openda and Lukaku have started together for their national team, and it seems a curious point of the tournament to experiment. Will Tedesco's tinkering pay off, though?",general,General,"Openda, Lukaku, Tedesco",Belgium,195
3941019,10,0,10,"Allowed to travel through midfield and towards the edge of Belgium's area, Griezmann eyes up a shot. However, his 20-yard effort is sent bobbling low along the turf, and Casteels comfortably gathers it.",general,General,"Griezmann, Casteels",France,198
3941019,12,0,12,"Griezmann and Kounde cleverly combine on the right flank, and the ball is cut back into the box by the latter, only to evade every French player. A real moment of concern for the Belgians there.",general,General,"Griezmann, Kounde",France,185
3941019,14,0,14,"After Hernandez lays a short pass off to Mbappe on the left side of the area, the France captain lashes an angled shot towards goal. It takes a deflection and flies wide, but the referee somehow misses the Belgian defender's touch and awards a goal kick instead.",general,Shot,"Hernandez, Mbappe",France,261
3941019,15,0,15,"YELLOW CARD!  After France are mistakenly denied a corner kick, Tchouameni protests a little too long and too loudly, so he receives the game's first booking. He'll have to tread carefully from now on.",key_event,Yellow Card,Tchouameni,France,190
3941019,17,0,17,"CHANCE!  France continue to press for an opening goal: Thuram arrives in front of his marker at the near post, only to steer a header from Griezmann's corner well wide of the target.",key_event,Chance,"Thuram, Griezmann",France,168
3941019,19,0,19,"It's quite surprising just how passively Belgium have started this match, perhaps paying their old rivals a little bit too much respect. They've barely laid a glove on Les Bleus thus far.",general,General,,Belgium,171
3941019,20,0,20,"With a wildly optimistic effort, Rabiot thumps a 30-yarder high and wide of the target. There was no pressure on the ball, so he felt entitled to have a go - surely the wrong option, though.",general,Shot,Rabiot,France,180
3941019,22,0,22,"YELLOW CARD!  Doku jinks in from the left, driving towards the edge of the area. With Kounde caught on his heels, Griezmann drops back to help out and clips the Manchester City winger. That's a booking - and a rather harsh one.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Doku, Kounde, Griezmann",France,237
3941019,24,0,24,"SAVE!  From a free kick on the left side of the box, De Bruyne curls the ball towards the centre of the goal. Maignan sees it late, then scrambles it away to safety with a very unorthodox stop! He hacks it away with his legs!",key_event,Save,"De Bruyne, Maignan",Belgium,225
3941019,25,0,25,"YELLOW CARD!  The referee is starting to dish cards out freely now: Rabiot is booked for fouling Doku and will miss a potential quarter-final with either Portugal or Slovenia.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Rabiot, Doku",France,161
3941019,26,0,26,"A pause in play for an injury to Doku allows both managers to give out some tactical instruction, and the players take on drinks, too. Fortunately, the Belgian winger is ultimately fit enough to return.",general,General,Doku,Both,188
3941019,28,0,28,"Carrasco has a volleyed shot blocked in the box, and there's no doubt that the Belgium have brightened up over the past 10 minutes or so. It had been a rather subdued start from the Red Devils.",general,Shot,Carrasco,Belgium,176
3941019,30,0,30,"France have had 58% of the ball so far, which demonstrates just how much they were on top in the early stages. It's developing into a much more even affair now, though.",general,General,,Both,154
3941019,32,0,32,"A pretty woeful cross from the left by Hernandez sails straight over the byline and out for a goal kick to Belgium. For all their possession, Les Bleus have produced just one shot on target today.",general,General,Hernandez,France,182
3941019,34,0,34,"CLOSE!  Again, Kounde advances down the right, and he delivers a dangerous ball to the near post. Thuram arrives to meet it with a well-timed leap, but his header zips narrowly wide of the right-hand post!",key_event,Close Call,"Kounde, Thuram",France,194
3941019,39,0,39,"CLOSE!  At the end of a long French build-up, Tchouameni spots a chance to shoot from mid-range, but his power-packed effort rises just over the top-right corner.",key_event,Close Call,Tchouameni,France,149
3941019,41,0,41,"France are now totally on top in Dusseldorf, where Belgium have again dropped deep. Even Openda and Lukaku are back inside their defensive third - they're all chasing shadows at the moment.",general,General,"Openda, Lukaku",France,180
3941019,43,0,43,"Thuram just can't reach the ball when Griezmann ends another clever passage of play by clipping a cute pass over the top. Casteels claims it, but Belgium are merely hanging on for half time here.",general,General,"Thuram, Griezmann, Casteels",France,186
3941019,45,0,45,"As France continue penning their opponents in, the officials indicate that just one minute of first-half stoppage time will be played.",general,General,,France,126
3941019,45,1,45+1,"CLOSE!  Right at the end of the half, Tchouameni again misses the target. Following persistent play by Mbappe on the left flank, the ball falls nicely for his new Real Madrid teammate; however, the subsequent shot is drilled about three feet over the top.",key_event,Close Call,"Tchouameni, Mbappe",France,250
3941019,45,0,45,HALF TIME:  FRANCE 0-0 BELGIUM,key_event,Half Time,,Both,30

3941019,48,0,48,"SAVE!  Tchouameni tries his luck again, but Casteels is equal to it! The midfielder's dominant display continues, following a fine first half, as he strides forward and curls a shot towards the bottom-right corner: Belgium's goalkeeper tips it away!",key_event,Save,"Tchouameni, Casteels",France,254
3941019,50,0,50,"CHANCE!  After an underwhelming set-piece situation, France recover the ball and then deliver it from the left towards Thuram at the near post. Again, the Inter Milan striker fails to connect correctly, and it comes off the top of his shoulder before flying well over the crossbar.",key_event,Chance,Thuram,France,268
3941019,52,0,52,"It's 'as you were', then. France have resumed their dominance of both ball and territory since half time, with Belgium meekly sitting back and vainly hoping to strike on the break.",general,General,,Both,170
3941019,54,0,54,"CLOSE!  Mbappe almost breaks the deadlock! The France captain weaves in from the left at top speed, leaving several defenders in his wake, but his dipping shot zips narrowly over the crossbar! Brilliant stuff from Les Bleus' skipper!",key_event,Close Call,Mbappe,France,237
3941019,56,0,56,"Not for the first time, Kounde advances to the right edge of the area, and his ball sets up Mbappe. However, the latter can't control his shot, which skips well wide of the left-hand post.",general,Shot,"Kounde, Mbappe",France,175
3941019,58,0,58,"Somehow, Doku extracts himself from a sticky situation: penned into the corner, near his own area, the winger's fleet footwork buys a free kick off Kounde. He took a risk there, but it payed off.",general,Free Kick,"Doku, Kounde",Belgium,179
3941019,60,0,60,"At the traditional hour mark, the time seems ripe for some substitutions. None appear to be on their way just yet, but Tedesco must surely be thinking of some changes; Deschamps, too.",general,General,"Tedesco, Deschamps",Both,181
3941019,61,0,61,"CHANCE!  AC Milan teammates Hernandez and Maignan celebrate as if they've just scored a goal, as Carrasco is denied a chance to shoot from close range when played through by De Bruyne. It was good defending, but the shot needed to be taken sooner.",key_event,Chance,"Hernandez, Maignan, Carrasco, De Bruyne",France,256
3941019,62,0,62,"FRANCE SUB: Deschamps decides to shuffle his forward line, as Thuram departs and Kolo Muani comes on.",key_event,Substitution,"Thuram, Kolo Muani, Deschamps",France,103
3941019,63,0,63,"BELGIUM SUB: Tedesco responds by sending on Mangala for Openda. Surely that'll release De Bruyne to do his stuff further up the pitch.",key_event,Substitution,"Mangala, Openda, Tedesco, De Bruyne",Belgium,130
3941019,65,0,65,"France flood forward again: this time, Griezmann latches onto a pass and pulls his low shot wide of the right-hand post.",general,Shot,Griezmann,France,120
3941019,67,0,67,"It growing ever more tense in Dusseldorf, where the one-way traffic continues. Can Belgium find a way to halt the French tide and start creating some of their own chances?",general,General,,Both,158
3941019,69,0,69,"CLOSE!  Tchouameni shoots over again, following fine build-up play from Mbappe and Griezmann. This time, the ball is fired narrowly off target from around 20 yards out.",key_event,Close Call,"Tchouameni, Mbappe, Griezmann",France,167
3941019,71,0,71,"SAVE!  Lukaku denied! Belgium almost snatch the lead, against the run of play! Mangala bursts down the left, then cuts the ball back for the Red Devils' record scorer; Lukaku shoots low and hard but Maignan is equal to it!",key_event,Save,"Lukaku, Mangala, Maignan",Belgium,221
3941019,73,0,73,"Penalties and own goals excluded, France haven't scored with any of their 63 shots at Euro 2024 so far. The frustration must be immense for fans of Les Bleus.",general,General,,France,154
3941019,74,0,74,"CLOSE!  Saliba shows great skill to evade Doku in the Belgian area, then lines up a shot. However, he becomes the latest French player to spurn a half-chance, shooting over from 15 yards.",key_event,Close Call,"Saliba, Doku",France,175
3941019,76,0,76,"YELLOW CARD!  After getting entangled with Kolo Muani by the touchline, Vertonghen is shown a yellow card by the referee. For his subsequent complaints, Tedesco joins his defender in the book.",key_event,Yellow Card,"Kolo Muani, Vertonghen, Tedesco",Belgium,191
3941019,78,0,78,"CLOSE!  Mbappe comes ever so close once again! He curls a first-time strike narrowly over the crossbar from just inside the area. Belgium can breathe again!",key_event,Close Call,Mbappe,France,149
3941019,80,0,80,"Both coaches have made just one change so far. Surely it's time to go for broke? Or are we ambling towards extra time in Dusseldorf?",general,General,,Both,132
3941019,82,0,82,"SAVE!  Good stop from Maignan! Lukaku holds the ball up well, then Doku flicks it through to the on-rushing De Bruyne to shoot. He hits it hard and true from the edge of the box, but France's number one makes an important save!",key_event,Save,"Maignan, Lukaku, Doku, De Bruyne",Belgium,231
3941019,85,0,85,GOAL!  FRANCE 1-0 BELGIUM (VERTONGHEN OWN GOAL),key_event,Goal,Vertonghen,Both,46
3941019,85,0,85,"GOAL!  France go in front! Just when it seemed they were all out of ideas! At the end of a smart passing move, Kante picks out Kolo Muani on the right side of the area, and the latter's shot is deflected past Casteels and into the back of the net! Vertonghen is the unlucky man, adding his name to several with own goals at Euro 2024.",key_event,Goal,"Kante, Kolo Muani, Casteels, Vertonghen",France,310

3941019,90,2,90+2,"In the second minute of at least three added for stoppages, Belgium are flooding forward in numbers. For the first time, France are on the back foot. Will Les Bleus see this out?",general,General,,Both,173
