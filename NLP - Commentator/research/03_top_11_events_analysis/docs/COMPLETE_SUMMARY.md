## 🔍 Data Structure Overview

### Starting Game Data
```
INPUT: Match context + Team statistics
├─ Match: stadium, referee, stage, teams
├─ Team A Stats: wins, draws, losses, goals, last result
└─ Team B Stats: same structure

OUTPUT: Pre-match commentary
"Welcome to [Stadium] for this [Stage] clash between [Team A] 
and [Team B]. [Team A] come into this match having recorded 
[Stats]..."
```

### Event Commentary Data
```
INPUT: Event sequence with full metadata
├─ Sequence: type, length, key event
├─ Match: teams, time, period
├─ Event: type, player, team, position
├─ Location: coordinates, zones
├─ Context: pressure, duration, play pattern
└─ Specific: pass/shot/dribble/carry details

OUTPUT: Event + Sequence commentary
Event: "Williams shoots with the left - BLOCKED!"
Sequence: "[11:08] Williams receives. Williams under pressure, 
drives forward. Stones closes down. Williams shoots - BLOCKED! 
Stones with crucial defending!"
```

Template: "{Player} {verb} {distance} {delivery} to {Recipient} {location}"

Example:
"Carvajal plays a medium pass along the ground to Olmo in the central midfield"
```

### **2. Shot Event**
```
Template: "{Player} {shot_type} from the {zone} - {outcome}!"

Example:
"Williams shoots with the left from the central attacking third - BLOCKED!"
```

### **3. Dribble Event**
```
Template: "{Player} takes on {Opponent}, {outcome}"

Example:
"Shaw takes on Carvajal - NUTMEG! Through the legs"
```

### **4. Carry Event**
```
Template: "{Player} {pressure} {action} {progression}"

Example:
"Williams under pressure, drives forward with the ball into the attacking third"
```

### **5. Pressure Event**

"Bellingham presses Carvajal in the right attacking third"
```

### **6. Sequence Flow**
```
Connection: ". " (period) or ", " (comma) or " - " (dramatic)

## 💡 Key Innovations

### **1. Neutral Tournament Terminology**
❌ Before: "home_team", "away_team" (implies home advantage)  
✅ After: "team_a", "team_b" (neutral for tournaments)

### **2. Complete Metadata Extraction**
❌ Before: Raw JSON strings in columns  
✅ After: 40 structured columns with parsed data

### **3. Field Zone Intelligence**
❌ Before: Just coordinates (99.4, 9.1)  
✅ After: "left attacking third" + contextual zones

### **4. Context-Aware Templates**
❌ Before: Generic "Player passes"  
✅ After: "Carvajal plays a medium pass along the ground to Olmo in the central midfield"

### **5. Event Relationships**
❌ Before: Isolated events  
✅ After: Connected sequences with causality (pass→receive, shot→block)

### **6. Emotional Variation**
❌ Before: Flat narration  
✅ After: "BLOCKED!", "NUTMEG!", "IT'S A GOAL!"

# Combine templates with neural generation
1. Templates provide structure
2. Neural model adds variety and fluency
3. Best of both worlds: consistency + creativity
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### **1. Context is Everything**
- Same event type (e.g., "Pass") can have many descriptions
- Location, pressure, distance, outcome all affect commentary
- Pre-match vs in-game requires different approaches

### **2. Metadata Richness**
- More metadata = More natural commentary
- Field zones more useful than raw coordinates
- Related events provide causality

### **3. Template Flexibility**
- Single rigid template = robotic
- Multiple templates with context = natural
- Emotional variation = engaging

### **4. Sequence Understanding**
- Events are connected, not isolated
- Key events deserve emphasis
- Flow and narrative structure matter
