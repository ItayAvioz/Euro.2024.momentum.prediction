## üìã Data Extraction Checklist

### Always Extract:
- ‚úÖ `player_name`
- ‚úÖ `team_name`
- ‚úÖ `minute`, `second`
- ‚úÖ `event_type`
- ‚úÖ `zone_combined`
- ‚úÖ `location_x`, `location_y`

### Event-Specific Fields:

**Pass:**
- `pass_recipient`
- `pass_length`
- `pass_height`
- `pass_outcome`

**Shot:**
- `shot_outcome`
- `shot_xg`
- `shot_body_part`

**Carry:**
- `carry_end_x`, `carry_end_y`
- `carry_distance`
- `duration`

**Dribble:**
- `dribble_outcome`
- `dribble_nutmeg`

**Pressure:**
- `duration`
- Target player (from context)

## üîÑ Context Integration

### Sequence-Level Context:
```python
# Use these fields to understand event flow
sequence_id         # Groups related events
event_position      # Order within sequence (1-5)
is_key_event        # Highlights important moments
sequence_type       # "shot_sequence", "dribble_sequence", etc.
```

### Finding Related Events:
```python
# Example: Find who is being pressed
sequence_events = df[df['sequence_id'] == current_sequence_id]
previous_event = sequence_events[sequence_events['event_position'] == current_pos - 1]
target_player = previous_event['player_name']
```

### Combining Event & Sequence Commentary:
```python
# Individual event
event_commentary = "Nicholas Williams Arthuer shoots - BLOCKED!"

# Full sequence context
sequence_commentary = "[11:08] Nicholas Williams Arthuer receives. " \
                     "Nicholas Williams Arthuer under pressure, carries forward. " \
                     "John Stones presses Nicholas Williams Arthuer. " \
                     "Nicholas Williams Arthuer shoots - BLOCKED!. " \
                     "BLOCKED by John Stones!"
```

---

## üí° Implementation Tips

### 1. Template Selection
```python
def generate_commentary(event):
    event_type = event['event_type']
    
    templates = {
        'Ball Receipt*': lambda e: f"{e['player_name']} receives",
        'Carry': format_carry,
        'Pressure': format_pressure,
        'Pass': format_pass,
        'Shot': format_shot,
        'Dribble': format_dribble,
        'Block': lambda e: f"BLOCKED by {e['player_name']}!",
        'Goal Keeper': lambda e: "Goalkeeper deals with it",
        'Dribbled Past': lambda e: "Dribbled Past",
        'Ball Recovery': lambda e: "Ball Recovery",
        'Duel': lambda e: "Duel"
    }
    
    return templates[event_type](event)
```

### 2. Context Extraction
```python
def get_sequence_context(df, sequence_id, event_position):
    """Extract context from surrounding events"""
    sequence = df[df['sequence_id'] == sequence_id].sort_values('event_position')
    
    current = sequence[sequence['event_position'] == event_position].iloc[0]
    previous = sequence[sequence['event_position'] < event_position]
    next_events = sequence[sequence['event_position'] > event_position]
    
    return {
        'current': current,
        'previous': previous.to_dict('records'),
        'next': next_events.to_dict('records')
    }
```

### 3. Data Validation
```python
def validate_event_data(event, event_type):
    """Check if required fields are present"""
    required_fields = {
        'Pass': ['player_name', 'pass_recipient', 'pass_length', 'pass_height'],
        'Shot': ['player_name', 'shot_outcome'],
        'Carry': ['player_name', 'under_pressure'],
        # ... etc
    }
    
    for field in required_fields.get(event_type, ['player_name']):
        if pd.isna(event.get(field)):
            return False
    return True
```

## üìä Usage Statistics

- **Complex Events** (need context): Pass, Pressure, Dribble (3 types)
- **Medium Events** (conditional logic): Carry, Shot (2 types)
- **Simple Events** (fixed template): Ball Receipt*, Block, Goal Keeper, Dribbled Past, Ball Recovery, Duel (6 types)

**Coverage:** These 11 event types cover **97.9%** of all events in the dataset.

## üéì Next Steps

1. **Train NLP Model** using `event_commentary_training_data.csv`
2. **Test Templates** with `generate_event_type_examples.py`
3. **Extend Coverage** to remaining 2.1% of events
4. **Add Variations** to templates for more natural language
5. **Integrate Context** from related_events columns
6. **Add Sentiment** based on match situation
