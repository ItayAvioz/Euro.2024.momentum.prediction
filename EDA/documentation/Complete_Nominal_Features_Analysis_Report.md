## 🔧 **Encoding Strategies for Momentum Modeling**

### **One-Hot Encoding** (Low Cardinality)
- **play_pattern** (9 categories)
- **related_events_count** (8 categories)
- **freeze_frame** (9 categories)
- **pass** (4 categories)

### **Target Encoding** (High Cardinality)
- **event_type/type** (33 categories) - encode by momentum impact

- **team features** (24 categories) - encode by team strength/performance

### **Frequency Encoding** (Medium Cardinality)
- **stadium** (11 categories)
- **referee** (19 categories)

### **Special Handling**
- **player** (497 categories) - consider player clustering or embeddings
- **match_id** (51 categories) - time-based encoding or match importance

## 🚀 **Momentum Modeling Readiness**

### **Strengths for Momentum Prediction**
✅ **Excellent Data Coverage**: 94% of features have <5% missing data
✅ **Rich Event Context**: Detailed event types and patterns
✅ **Complete Tournament Coverage**: All teams, matches, and venues
✅ **Temporal Precision**: Event-level granularity
✅ **Spatial Information**: Position and team data

### **Implementation Recommendations**

#### **Phase 1: Core Features**
Start with high-priority features:
- `event_type` (primary momentum driver)
- `play_pattern` (momentum context)
- `position` (role-based impact)
- `team` information (team-specific patterns)

#### **Phase 2: Contextual Enhancement**
Add medium-priority features:
- `player` (individual impact)
- `related_events_count` (event chains)
- Team-specific features

#### **Phase 3: Fine-tuning**
Consider low-priority features for model refinement:
- Match context (stadium, referee)
- Complex event features (freeze_frame)

### **Data Quality Considerations**
- **Pass feature**: 71.3% missing - use as binary (pass/no pass) flag
- **Position feature**: 0.46% missing - impute or create "Unknown" category
- **JSON objects**: Parse for modeling or use simplified string versions

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Feature Engineering**: Create momentum-relevant encodings based on priority
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Check relationships between nominal features
3. **Temporal Integration**: Combine with ordinal features (time, period, stage)
4. **Continuous Integration**: Merge with location, score, and duration features
5. **Model Development**: Build momentum prediction pipeline with encoded features
