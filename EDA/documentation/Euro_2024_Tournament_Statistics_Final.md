## 🔍 **Detailed Methodology Explanations**

### **🟡 Yellow Cards Analysis**
- **Total Found**: 56 yellow cards
- **Method Used**: Analyzed `bad_behaviour` column for Yellow Card entries
- **Explanation**: 
  - Searched through the `bad_behaviour` column which contains detailed card information
  - Each yellow card event is recorded with specific card type data in JSON-like structures
  - Parsed the structures to identify genuine yellow card incidents
  - Cross-validated by checking for "Yellow Card" strings in the bad_behaviour data
  - **Why this method**: The `event_type` column didn't contain specific card events, but the `bad_behaviour` column had detailed card information with precise categorization

### **🔴 Red Cards Analysis**
- **Total Found**: 2 red cards
- **Method Used**: Analyzed `bad_behaviour` column for Red Card entries
- **Explanation**:
  - Similar approach to yellow cards, searched the `bad_behaviour` column
  - Looked for both "Red Card" and "Second Yellow" entries (second yellow = red card dismissal)
  - Includes both direct red cards and dismissals via second yellow card
  - Each dismissal properly categorized and counted once
  - **Why this method**: The dedicated bad_behaviour column provided the most accurate and detailed card information compared to general event types

### **⚪ Corners Analysis**
- **Total Found**: 449 corner kicks
- **Corner Events in Dataset**: 7,722 total events
- **Method Used**: Analyzed `play_pattern` for 'From Corner' sequences
- **Explanation**:
  - **Challenge**: Each corner kick generates multiple related events (corner taken, ball cleared, header attempted, etc.)
  - **Solution**: Counted unique corner sequences by analyzing `play_pattern` changes to "From Corner"
  - **Process**: 
    1. Identified all events with `play_pattern` containing "Corner"
    2. Grouped events by match
    3. Analyzed event indices to detect new corner sequences (gaps > 10 indices indicate new corner)
    4. Counted unique corner kicks rather than all corner-related events
  - **Validation**: 7,722 corner-related events ÷ 449 corner kicks = ~17 events per corner (reasonable for corner sequences)
  - **Why this method**: Avoids double-counting by focusing on corner initiation rather than all subsequent events
