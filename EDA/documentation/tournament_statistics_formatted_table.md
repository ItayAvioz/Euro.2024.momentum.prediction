# Tournament Statistics by Stage Table (Normalized)

## Key Findings:
- **Round of 16**: 25% of games (2/8) went to extra time
- **Quarter-finals**: 75% of games (3/4) went to extra time - most competitive stage
- **Normalization Impact**: Extra time significantly affects statistics, requiring per-90min analysis

## Normalization Impact Analysis:

### **Most Affected Stages:**
1. **Quarter-finals**: Largest impact from extra time
   - Goals: 2.00 → 1.60 per 90min (-20.0%)
   - Substitutions: 10.50 → 8.40 per 90min (-20.0%)
   - Corners: 8.25 → 6.60 per 90min (-20.0%)

2. **Round of 16**: Moderate impact
   - Goals: 2.38 → 2.19 per 90min (-7.7%)
   - Substitutions: 8.88 → 8.19 per 90min (-7.7%)
   - Corners: 8.25 → 7.62 per 90min (-7.6%)

### **Key Insights:**
- **Quarter-finals** were the most defensively tight stage (lowest goals per 90min: 1.60)
- **Extra time frequency** increases dramatically in knockout rounds (0% → 25% → 75%)
- **Substitution intensity** peaks in Quarter-finals but normalizes significantly per 90min
- **Disciplinary actions** increase through knockout stages but normalize when accounting for time
- **Corner generation** shows similar patterns to goals - decreasing efficiency in longer games

### **Momentum Modeling Implications:**
- Use **normalized per-90min statistics** for knockout stage comparisons
- **Quarter-finals dynamics** represent peak defensive intensity in tournament
- **Extra time periods** may require separate momentum modeling approaches
- **Stage-specific features** needed to account for tournament progression pressure
