## 📝 EDA Insights CSV Updates

### 🆕 Added 3 New Insights:

#### 1. **Player Involvement Analysis**
- **Finding**: 99.54% events have player involvement
- **Impact**: Medium priority for momentum analysis strategies
- **Status**: Need to verify if 0.46% non-player events are valid
- **Details**: 186,994 events with players vs 864 without

#### 2. **Duration Data Quality Issues**
- **Finding**: 27.48% missing + 6,932 outliers (max 35.96 seconds)
- **Impact**: Medium priority for event timing analysis
- **Status**: Need to investigate missing patterns and extreme outliers
- **Details**: Outliers range from 3.62s to 35.96s duration

#### 3. **Away Score Outliers**
- **Finding**: 16,736 events with away_score = 3 (maximum value)
- **Impact**: Low priority but should validate high-scoring games
- **Status**: Review for data validation
- **Details**: Score 3 may be unusual but could represent valid results

## 🎯 Momentum Analysis Impact

### Temporal Precision Features (Ordinal)
- **Tournament Timeline**: `match_date` + `stage` provide competition context
- **Match Timing**: `period` + `minute` + `second` give precise timing
- **Event Context**: `match_week` + `kick_off` add scheduling effects

### Data Quality Insights
- **High Player Coverage**: 99.54% player involvement validates player-based features
- **Duration Concerns**: 27% missing + outliers need investigation for timing analysis
- **Score Validation**: High away scores (3 goals) require verification

## 📁 Files Updated/Created

### ✅ New Visualization Files:
- `visualization/match_date_ordinal_chart.png` (525KB)
- `visualization/stage_ordinal_chart.png` (384KB)

### ✅ Updated Analysis Files:
- `analysis/categorical_feature_statistics_complete.csv` (updated with 2 new features)
- `thoughts/eda_insights.csv` (3 new insights added)

### ✅ Documentation:
- Complete ordinal feature analysis (7/7 features)
- Updated EDA insights with data quality findings

## 🚀 Next Steps Ready

### For Momentum Modeling:
1. **Complete Temporal Coverage**: All timing features analyzed (period → stage progression)
2. **Data Quality Baseline**: Key issues identified for preprocessing
3. **Feature Engineering**: Tournament context + match timing available
4. **Validation Pipeline**: Insights documented for model validation

### Recommended Actions:
1. Investigate duration outliers (35.96s max seems excessive)
2. Verify non-player events (0.46% of data)  
3. Validate high away scores (score=3 in 16,736 events)
4. Use complete ordinal feature set for momentum prediction
