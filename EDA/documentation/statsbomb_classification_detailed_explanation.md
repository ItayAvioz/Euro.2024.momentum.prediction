## 🔍 DETAILED STATSBOMB CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

### **🎯 SHOTS ON TARGET (557 shots, 41.6%)**

#### **What Qualifies as "On Target":**
Shots that would have gone into the goal if not for goalkeeper intervention or hitting the frame.

#### **📋 StatsBomb Outcome IDs - ON TARGET:**

| **Outcome ID** | **Description** | **Count** | **% of Total** | **Explanation** |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **97** | **Goal** | **126** | **9.4%** | ⚽ Ball crosses goal line completely |
| **100** | **Saved** | **316** | **23.6%** | 🥅 Goalkeeper makes a save |
| **101** | **Post/Crossbar** | **25** | **1.9%** | 🎯 Hits woodwork (would have gone in) |
| **Various** | **Other On Target** | **90** | **6.7%** | 📌 Deflections, keeper parries, etc. |

#### **🔬 Why These Count as "On Target":**
- **Goals**: Obviously on target - the ultimate outcome
- **Saves**: Required goalkeeper intervention to prevent goal
- **Post/Bar**: Would have been goals without the frame
- **Other**: Various deflections that were goal-bound

---

### **🔴 SHOTS OFF TARGET (397 shots, 29.6%)**

#### **What Qualifies as "Off Target":**
Shots that miss the goal entirely without any intervention.

#### **📋 StatsBomb Outcome IDs - OFF TARGET:**

| **Outcome ID** | **Description** | **Count** | **% of Total** | **Explanation** |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **102** | **Wayward** | **81** | **6.0%** | ↗️ Shot goes wide/high of goal |
| **Various** | **Off Target** | **316** | **23.6%** | ❌ General misses without interference |

#### **🔬 Why These Count as "Off Target":**
- Shot direction would not have resulted in a goal
- No goalkeeper intervention required
- Ball misses the goal frame entirely
- Includes shots over the bar, wide of posts

---

### **🟠 SHOTS BLOCKED (386 shots, 28.8%)**

#### **What Qualifies as "Blocked":**
Shots that are intercepted by outfield players before reaching the goal.

#### **📋 StatsBomb Outcome IDs - BLOCKED:**

| **Outcome ID** | **Description** | **Count** | **% of Total** | **Explanation** |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **103** | **Blocked** | **386** | **28.8%** | 🛡️ Defender/player blocks shot |

#### **🔬 Why Blocked Shots Are Separate:**
- Never tested the goalkeeper
- Cannot determine original shot direction/quality
- Represents defensive intervention, not shooting accuracy
- Not counted in traditional "shots on target" calculations

---

## 🧮 CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### **📊 How We Calculate Accuracy:**

#### **🎯 Shot Accuracy Formula:**
```
Shot Accuracy = (Shots on Target ÷ Total Shots) × 100
             = (557 ÷ 1,340) × 100 = 41.6%
```

#### **⚽ Overall Conversion Rate:**
```
Conversion Rate = (Goals ÷ Total Shots) × 100
                = (126 ÷ 1,340) × 100 = 9.4%
```

#### **🥅 On Target Conversion Rate:**
```
On Target Conversion = (Goals ÷ Shots on Target) × 100
                     = (126 ÷ 557) × 100 = 22.6%
```

#### **🛡️ Defensive Block Rate:**
```
Block Rate = (Blocked Shots ÷ Total Shots) × 100
           = (386 ÷ 1,340) × 100 = 28.8%
```

## ⏱️ NORMALIZATION TO 90 MINUTES

### **🔢 Why Normalization Matters:**

| **Stage** | **Extra Time %** | **Raw Shots/Game** | **Normalized per 90min** | **Impact** |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| **Group Stage** | 0.0% | 25.06 | 25.06 | **0.0%** |
| **Round of 16** | 25.0% | 29.50 | 27.23 | **-7.7%** |
| **QF+SF+Final** | 42.9% | 28.86 | 25.25 | **-12.5%** |

### **📐 Normalization Formula:**
```
1. Total 90min Equivalent = Total Actual Minutes ÷ 90
2. Normalized Stat = Total Stat ÷ Total 90min Equivalent
3. Impact % = ((Per 90min - Per Game) ÷ Per Game) × 100
```

## 🏆 TOURNAMENT PROGRESSION INSIGHTS

### **📈 Key Findings by Stage:**

#### **🎯 Shot Volume (Normalized per 90min):**
- **Group Stage**: 25.06 shots/90min (baseline)
- **Round of 16**: 27.23 shots/90min (+8.7% intensity)
- **QF+SF+Final**: 25.25 shots/90min (similar to Group Stage)

#### **🎪 Shot Quality Evolution:**
- **Shot Accuracy**: 41.8% → 39.4% → **43.1%** (peaks in finals)
- **Conversion Rate**: 8.2% → 8.5% → **15.8%** (doubles in finals!)
- **On Target Conversion**: 19.6% → 21.5% → **36.8%** (clinical finishing)

#### **🛡️ Defensive Consistency:**
- **Block Rate**: ~29% across all stages (consistent defensive pressure)

## 🔬 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **📝 Data Parsing Process:**

#### **1. Event Identification:**
```python
shot_events = events[events['type'].astype(str).str.contains('Shot', na=False)]
```

#### **2. Outcome Parsing:**
```python
shot_dict = ast.literal_eval(shot_detail_str)
outcome = shot_dict.get('outcome', {})
outcome_id = outcome.get('id', 0)
outcome_name = outcome.get('name', '').lower()
```

#### **3. Classification Logic:**
```python
if outcome_id == 97 or 'goal' in outcome_name:
    classification = 'on_target', is_goal = True
elif outcome_id == 100 or 'saved' in outcome_name:
    classification = 'on_target'
elif outcome_id == 101 or 'post' in outcome_name:
    classification = 'on_target'
elif outcome_id == 103 or 'blocked' in outcome_name:
    classification = 'blocked'
else:
    classification = 'off_target'
```
