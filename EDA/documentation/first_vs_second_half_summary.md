4. **Discipline**: Pressure and fatigue lead to significantly more cards in second half
5. **Coaching Impact**: Massive substitution increase shows tactical adjustments are primarily made in second half

## Impact for Momentum Modeling

- **Period effects** should be incorporated as features
- **Event density changes** between halves affect momentum patterns
- **Substitution timing** creates momentum shift opportunities
- **Disciplinary escalation** in second half affects game flow
- **Shot efficiency improvements** in second half suggest momentum-goal relationships vary by period
